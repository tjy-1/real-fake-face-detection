AI-Powered Fake Image Detection 🧠🔍

🌟 Project Overview
This project uses deep learning to distinguish between real and fake images with impressive accuracy. We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset of authentic and manipulated images, providing a user-friendly interface for easy predictions.

🔎 Why This Matters
In a world where fake images spread rapidly, detecting manipulated content is crucial for media, security, and everyday users. This project aims to contribute to the fight against misinformation by leveraging AI for image authentication.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework
Flask: API for serving the model
HTML/CSS: Frontend design for the user interface
PIL & NumPy: Image processing and numerical operations

🚀 Features
Upload images easily via the web interface
Real-time predictions with confidence scores
Simple, intuitive design
Stored prediction history for future reference

🛠️ How It Works
Preprocessing: Resizes and normalizes images.
Prediction: CNN model classifies the image as real or fake.
Results: Displays predictions with confidence scores.
